If you are implementing the Library Management System in Go, hereâ€™s a general overview of how you would approach the project without including specific code files:

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a Library Management System using Go, adhering to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and design patterns. This system enables users to manage books, including adding, removing, searching, and listing them. Additionally, the project demonstrates the application of SOLID principles and patterns such as Singleton and Factory.

Key Features
Book Management:

Maintain a collection of books in the library.
Each book includes attributes such as title, author, ISBN, and availability.
Enhanced OOP Features:

Include an EBook subclass with an additional attribute for file size.
Demonstrate polymorphism by overriding methods to include EBook-specific details.
Menu-Driven Console Application:

Allow users to interact with the library through a text-based menu.
Options to add, remove, search, and list books.
Design Patterns:

Singleton Pattern: Ensure a single instance of the LibraryManager class for managing operations.
Factory Pattern: Use a factory to create instances of Book or EBook dynamically.
Implementation Plan
Create Core Structures:

Define a Book struct with attributes like title, author, ISBN, and availability.
Extend the Book struct with an EBook struct, adding a file size attribute.
Library Functionality:

Build a Library struct to manage a collection of books.
Implement methods to add, remove, search, and list books.
Library Manager:

Create a LibraryManager class to provide a user-friendly interface.
Implement a text-based menu to navigate library operations.
Apply Design Patterns:

Refactor the LibraryManager class to follow the Singleton pattern.
Introduce a BookFactory class to create Book and EBook objects based on user input.
Menu System:

Use a loop-based menu to repeatedly accept user inputs for various operations.
Validate user inputs and provide appropriate feedback.
Advantages of Using Go
Simplicity and Performance:

Go provides straightforward syntax, making it easy to implement and debug.
Its compiled nature ensures excellent runtime performance.
Concurrency:

Go's built-in support for concurrency (goroutines) can be leveraged to handle multiple users or operations simultaneously in the future.
Strong Typing and Static Analysis:

Go's type system helps catch errors at compile time, leading to fewer runtime issues.
Standard Library:

Extensive standard libraries simplify tasks like input handling, file management, and formatting.
OOP and SOLID Principles in Use
Encapsulation:

Encapsulate attributes and behaviors in Book, Library, and LibraryManager.
Inheritance:

Implement the EBook struct as an extension of the Book struct.
Polymorphism:

Override methods to customize behavior for Book and EBook.
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

Ensure that each class and method handles only a single responsibility.
Factory Pattern:

Centralize object creation logic in a BookFactory.
Singleton Pattern:

Restrict the LibraryManager to a single instance throughout the application lifecycle.
Suggested Enhancements
Data Persistence:

Save library data to a file or database to retain information across application runs.
Error Handling:

Add robust error handling for user inputs and unexpected conditions.
Improved User Interface:

Replace the text-based menu with a graphical user interface (GUI) or web interface.
Advanced Features:

Add user authentication, borrowing/returning books, and overdue notifications.
